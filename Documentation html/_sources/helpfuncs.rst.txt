Web scraping functions
======================

Introduction
------------
Functions for scraping information off Wikipedia off wikipedia to ease the workflow of bigger excels. First function searches the html-code of the wanted page for tags and information under them, whereas the second one searches for wanted keywords from the whole page.

One needs to note that I am especially proud of the following code as it required me to finally go and learn the Regular expressions properly::

	for i in soup.find_all(text=wantedInfo):
        	p = re.compile('>[^<>].[^<>]*<')
        	r = p.findall(str(i.parent.parent))

This can be found from the :func:`webScrapingFunctions.searchForCompanyInfo` function.
